# SQL Injection

## Local mysql server

`mysql.server start`

`mysql -u root`

In simple cases, the output of both the intended and the new query may be printed directly on the front end, and we can directly read it. This is known as **In-band SQL injection**, and it has two types: Union Based and Error Based.
