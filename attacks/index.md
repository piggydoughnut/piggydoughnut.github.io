# Attacks

## Phishing

Social engineering with a touch of spoofing. The goal is to get sensitive information or get a person to install a mallware.
Often delivered via email trying to get the victim to click a link.
Some emails look super legit (good design, good grammar, relevant service), but there is always something a little odd.

- Always check Urls for typos and misspellings
- Don't click link but go to the page directly

**Pharming** - attack a whole group of people, attacker took over a website or a DNS server.

**Vishing** - voice phishing, caller ID spoofing, trying to get personal information to gain access to your account

**Spear phishing** - very targeted phishing attack, to make it very believable

**Whaling** - targeted phishing attack for a higher executive in the company (CFO, CEO)

**Smishing** - SMS phishing, contain links

Background information is easy to gather from public sites like: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, company websites, etc.

Scammer builds a profile of you and basically knows everything about you - where you work, bank, you recent purchases, family, friends, events you went to.

## Impersonating

There is an actor and a story. Someone is trying to pretend to be someone else (Microsoft representative, bank, etc.) to gain some information/action/response/personal data from you.

The attacker will use information about you during the conversation to make the attack more tailored for you sepcifically (your bank branch). In order to build trust they might use some information that you might know (your company info, local info, etc). They can pretend to be higher in rank than you or use loads of tech terms, etc.

The attacker extracts data without the victim noticing.

Personal details are very valuable. Identity fraud is a massice problem around the world (credit card, loan, lease, tax, government benefits fraud etc).

Never volunteer information over the phone! Verify who is calling.

## Dumpster Diving

Gathering of personal information from what was thrown out to use those in a different attack.

Legal? Legal in the US.

Lock and secure your garbage to prevent people from accessing it.

## Shoulder surfing

Looking over your shoulder when you are accessing important information on your computer.

Privacy filters, controlling your environment, turn monitor away from window or hallway,

## Hoaxes

A threat that doesnt actually exist. Situation might seem to be real but it is not.

Facebook post, email, tweet, etc.

Viruses or malware that look like you are affected with that type of mallware.

Update your Java/Flash player. A very well done sw update page.

## Watering Hole Attack

Attacker goes to the third party, e.g. third party site, local coffee or sandwich shop.

Attackers focus on infecting the third party site.

Defense in depth - layered defense.
Firewalls and IPS - stop the network traffic before things get bad

E.g. a mallware is installed on deviced of people who belong to a certain group.
