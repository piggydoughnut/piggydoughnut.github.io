# Attacks

## Phishing

Social engineering with a touch of spoofing. The goal is to get sensitive information or get a person to install a mallware.
Often delivered via email trying to get the victim to click a link.
Some emails look super legit (good design, good grammar, relevant service), but there is always something a little odd.

- Always check Urls for typos and misspellings
- Don't click link but go to the page directly

**Pharming** - attack a whole group of people, attacker took over a website or a DNS server.

**Vishing** - voice phishing, caller ID spoofing, trying to get personal information to gain access to your account

**Spear phishing** - very targeted phishing attack, to make it very believable

**Whaling** - targeted phishing attack for a higher executive in the company (CFO, CEO)

**Smishing** - SMS phishing, contain links

Various scams - https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/

Background information is easy to gather from public sites like: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, company websites, etc.

Scammer builds a profile of you and basically knows everything about you - where you work, bank, you recent purchases, family, friends, events you went to.

## Impersonating

There is an actor and a story. Someone is trying to pretend to be someone else (Microsoft representative, bank, etc.) to gain some information/action/response/personal data from you.

The attacker will use information about you during the conversation to make the attack more tailored for you sepcifically (your bank branch). In order to build trust they might use some information that you might know (your company info, local info, etc). They can pretend to be higher in rank than you or use loads of tech terms, etc.

The attacker extracts data without the victim noticing.

Personal details are very valuable. Identity fraud is a massice problem around the world (credit card, loan, lease, tax, government benefits fraud etc).

Never volunteer information over the phone! Verify who is calling.

## Dumpster Diving

Gathering of personal information from what was thrown out to use those in a different attack.

Legal? Legal in the US.

Lock and secure your garbage to prevent people from accessing it.

## Shoulder surfing

Looking over your shoulder when you are accessing important information on your computer.

Privacy filters, controlling your environment, turn monitor away from window or hallway,

## Hoaxes

A threat that doesnt actually exist. Situation might seem to be real but it is not.

Facebook post, email, tweet, etc.

Viruses or malware that look like you are affected with that type of mallware.

Update your Java/Flash player. A very well done sw update page.

## Watering Hole Attack

Attacker goes to the third party, e.g. third party site, local coffee or sandwich shop.

Attackers focus on infecting the third party site.

Defense in depth - layered defense.
Firewalls and IPS - stop the network traffic before things get bad

E.g. a mallware is installed on deviced of people who belong to a certain group.

## Spam

Unsolicited messages - commercial advertising, malicious phishing.

Issues with spam - security concernts, resource utilization, storage costs, managing it.

SPIM - Spam over instant messaging

Ways to stop spam:

- Have your spam filter - filtering in the cloud or on site in a screened subnet. Mail coming from the internet is filtered in Mail Gateway and spam is thrown out before its transferred to an internal mail server.

Characteristics for filtration:

- Allowed list only (only trusted senders)
- Block anything that doesnt follow RFC standards
- Reverse DNS - block email where the senders domain doesnt math the IP address of the domain.
- Tarpitting - intentionally slowing down the mail server - sending and receiving is slow
- Recipient filtering - block all mail not addressed to a valid recipient email address

## Influence campaign

The goal is to sway public opinion on political and social issues. This is enabled through social media - creating, sharing, liking, etc.

Bad actor creates bad accounts -> create content -> post it on many different platforms -> their messages gets amplified and more people read the content -> real people start sharing it to other people -> mass media picks up the story as it gets popular.

Reasons for these campaigns can even be military aka cyberwarfare. E.g. influencing elections, "fake news".

## Social engineering attacks

Social engineering uses a lot of open source intelligence, using social media and overall information on the internet. E.g. email a funeral notification of a friend or associates.

Main principles:

- Authority - message comes from CEO or help desk
- Intimidation - bad things will happen if you dont react, give them information, perform an action. "If you dont help me than the payroll checks wont be processed"
- Consensus/ Social proof - convince based on whats expected or known, using personal information or mentioning people you know.
- Scarcity - must make the change before time expires, something will go away in a time frame
- Urgency - act quickly, don't think
- Familiarity/Liking - mention someone you know, common friends.
- Trust - the attacker prentends to be someone who is safe, e.g. from IT deparment etc.

### Tailgating

Use an authorized person to gain unauthorized access to a building. Important to prevent as its last line of defence - entrance door.

- People blend in using clothing
- other legitimate 3d party reasons to enter the building
- sit in a smoking section and then follow employees inside the building
- carry food like doughnuts and have their hands full

### Invoice scam

Attacker sends a fake ivoice to the person who takes care of invoicing in the organization. (Attack starts with spear phishing). E.g. invoice for toner cartridges, domain renewal. Invoice if from a spoofed version of the CEO etc.

## Credential Harvesting

Attacker tries to get access to usernames and passwords stored locally on your computer in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Outlook etc). To extract credentials a script needs to run on your machine.
To prevent - antivirus, antimalware to scan for these types of attacks.

## [Logic Bombs](https://youtu.be/javj1IqXKW0)

Type of attack that occurs when a separate event is triggered. Commonly are left by someone with a grudge, ex employee. Difficult to identify as it does not follow any known patterns, no known signatures for anti malware sw. Manby logic bombs delete itself after execution.

Prevention: Formal set of processes and controls for any server environment changes, alerts on changes, host based intrusion prevention. Important to have auditing of alert systems.

## Password attacks

Some apps store passwords in plaintext still. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Hashes FTW. Random salt FTW!

Spraying attack - use common top 3 passwords before moving on.

Brute force - try every possible password combination until the hash is matched.

Dictionary attacks - common words taken from a dictionary to try. e.g. medical dictionary, insurance, etc. Password crackers can substitue letters, e.g. p&ssw0rd. GPU and distributed cracking - quickly performed calculations.

Rainbow table - prebuilt set of hashes, easily searchable

## Physical attacks

### Malicious devices

Malicious USB cable - HID, Human Interface Device like a keyboard

Malicious USB flash drive - can also act as a HID, can have malicious pdf files or macros for spreadsheets, can turn into a wireless interface (host) for outside devices to connect to your machine

### Skimming

Stealing credit card information as the card is used in ATM - magnetic stripe, gathering info from a computer system that it is plugged into. ATM will have a camera or a cardreader.

### Card Cloning

The whole card is cloned with all the details and the magnetic stripe (not chips)

## Supply chain attack

The production chain contains many moving parts - raw materials, suppliers, manufactureres, distributors, customers and consumers.

Attackers infect any step along the way. People tend to trust their suppliers.

Can you trust your new server/router/switch/firewall/software? Supply chain cyber security.

Companies try to use a smaller supplier base with tighter vendor controls, strict policies and procedures.

## Cloud based vs. on-premises attacks

Data is on premises - complete control over everything, you are in charge of the facility, users and support team. You can have on site IT team that can manage security better (can be pricey). No need to reach out to 3d party as all can be done in house.

Cloud based - you decided how much security you want for your data. Your data is accessible to a 3d party at all times. Cloud providers know how to manage large scale security projects. You have to make sure your users follow security procedures when access data. The downtime can be very limited, plus there could be easy add-ons like easy to install firewalls.

## Cryptographic attacks

Birthday attack - There is a classroom of 23 students, what is the chance of two students sharing a birthday? About 50%. 70% with 30 students.

Hash collision - same hash for two different plaintext values. Never happens unless the hash output size is not big enough.

Downgrade attack - force the systems to downgrade the security of encryption for the communication happening between two systems (man in the middle).

SSL 3.0 - insecure, Poodle downgrade attack

## Privilege escalation

Attacker is using normal user access to a system to gain elevated rights on the system using privilege escalation through vulnerability or design flaw.

It is important to patch and update to make sure all is up to date and secure.
