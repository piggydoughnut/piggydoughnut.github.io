# Malware

Malicious software - manipulate your computer and data and report to attacker.

To prevent malware installation - dont click links in email :)

Malware can install itself via:

- web page pop up
- drive by download
- vulnerability exploited by a worm
- keep your OS and applications updated

## Viruses

- malware that can reproduce itself. It needs the user to execute a program to start the virus replication process.

Once the virus is launched, virus can use file systems or network to reproduce.

Types:

- program virus - virus is a part of the application that you are running
- boot sector virus - exists in the boot sector of the storage device, just start the OS and the virus is on
- script viruses - operation or browser based scripts
- macro virus - common in Microsoft Office
- fileless virus - never installs or saves itself as a file on your system, it avoids anti virus software this way. It operates in the computer memory, inside of RAM. E.g. Link on a website or inside of an email -> Downloads software that runs as a Flash/Java file -> a vulnerability in Flash or Java is exploited and a script is run in PowerShell -> PowerShell scripts and executables are run in memory of the system -> adds itself to registry on auto start.

## Crypto Malware

Form of ransomware, that encrypts all of your personal information. You need to obtain the encryption key by sending attacker money.

## Ransomware

Your computer is "locked" and data taken hostage. Early forms were hoaxes.

Protect yourself by :

- backing up, offline preferably
- patch your OS
- updates apps
- keep anti virus/anti malware is up to date

## Worms

A worm takes advantage of the vulnerability in operating system or an application to be able to move itself from system to system using internet connectivity or local networks. Can jump from machine to machine without human intervention. They are very good at propagating itself quickly, a large number of affected machines in a short time.

Firewalls and IPS can mitigate worm infestations. Once the worm is identified and a signature is created worm can be stopped.

## Trojan Horses

It is software that prenteds to be something else.

- looks like a normal software, e.g. game, spreadsheet, image editing sw, etc.
- designed to look non theratening to anti virus sw

Once trojan horse is running it can disable your security tools, configure backdoors or download additional malware.

Trojan horse downloads a PUP (potentially unwanted program) - not necessarily malicious, but can cause performance issues on the computer. E.g. browser toolbar, sw that redirects all your google requests to a different search engine, backup utility that dispalys ads.

Backdoor - new way to get into your system.

RAT - remote access Trojan, remote administartion tool. Gives the attacker complete access to the OS: keylogging, screen shots and recordings, copy files, download more malware.

## Rootkit

Rootkit modifies files in the kernel of the OS. It becomes part of the OS iteself, so it is not viisble to anti virus sw.

Malware + rootkit = created a botnet that is difficult to remove from a system. E.g. Zeus/Zbot malware. Once installed it is almost impossible to delete.

Some anti malware/virus sw can identify rootkits.

BIOS sw - secure boot with EUFI - checks if any part of the kernal has been modfied and prevents booting a modified system.

## Spyware

Spies on you and tries to identify personal information about you (e.g. identity threat), browser monitoring (capture habits), keyloggers (capture keystrokes)

Can be installed as a Trojan Horse.

### Keylogger

### Adware

Can included with other software, makes a lot of pop ups and ads. Adware removes might bring more adware.

## Botnet

Bot malware installed to a system as Trojan horse.
Botnet is a network of bots, controlled using Command and Control server (C&C).

Botnet can:

- cause a Distributed Denial of Service attack
- Replay spam
- proxy network traffice
- distributed computing tasks

Prevent by

- making sure OS and apps are updated with latest security patches and anti mal/vir sw has the latest signatures.
- watch network for unusual traffic
- block at the firewall the type of traffic usually used at Command and Control
